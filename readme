An applet to run lightouse reports, page speed tests and screenshots of the webistes I manage. Uses theses great NPM packages: [site-audit-seo](https://github.com/viasite/site-audit-seo) and [capture-website-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/capture-website-cli), which both in turn use [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer). Next step is to remove all the hardcoded values and ask for user input for the the sites to scan.

## Dependencies

```bash
npm i site-audit-seo capture-website-cli
```
